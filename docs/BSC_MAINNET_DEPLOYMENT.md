## Admin Wallet Responsibilities

The admin wallet (`0x2B7A7cbb2FE3bFE97fB0Ba21909Df83346A6e782`) now has the following capabilities:

### Token Contract
- Grant/revoke GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE
- Grant/revoke PAUSE_ROLE
- Pause/unpause token transfers in emergencies

### Game Contract
- Distribute rewards from all vaults
- Configure game parameters
- Manage reward distributor roles

### Partner Vault
- Allocate tokens to partners
- Manage partner withdrawal schedules

---

## Game Admin Responsibilities

The game admin wallet (`0x178113a73061f2049268cebadbf753e93b2aa965`) has operational access:

### Game Contract
- Distribute player rewards
- Configure game mechanics
- Monitor vault balances

---

## Next Steps

### 0. Finalize Security (Optional)
Revoke the final deployer ADMIN_ROLE from Vault:

```bash
# Switch to admin wallet in .env
npx hardhat run scripts/revoke-deployer-vault-role.js --network bsc
```

This is non-critical since deployer no longer has DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, but recommended for complete security.

### 1. Partner Allocations
Use the Partner Vault to allocate tokens to partners:

```javascript
// Example: Allocate 10M tokens to a partner
await partnerVault.allocateToPartner(
  "0xPartnerAddress",
  ethers.parseEther("10000000")
);
```

### 2. Reward Distribution
Distribute rewards through the Game Contract:

```javascript
// Example: Distribute player task rewards
await game.distributeFromVault(
  0, // PLAYER_TASKS vault
  [player1, player2, player3],
  [amount1, amount2, amount3]
);
```

### 3. API Setup
Configure the API backend with contract addresses:

```env
TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x73331cb65cfb32b609178B75F70e00216b788401
GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xCF97d0f90c42BfE76AfA6085d3d32B3D1D93A6c6
PARTNER_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x44355B0681b257df40541211884ebB00B240aC57
NETWORK=bsc
CHAIN_ID=56
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Security Considerations:**
- Keep admin wallet private keys secure
- Use hardware wallet for admin operations
- Monitor contract events regularly
- Test transactions on testnet first

⚠️ **Final Security Step:**
- Deployer still has Vault ADMIN_ROLE (non-critical)
- Admin can revoke using `scripts/revoke-deployer-vault-role.js`
- This role cannot allocate tokens without DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
- Recommended to revoke for complete peace of mind

⚠️ **Partner Vault:**
- 3-year lockup period from allocation date
- Cannot withdraw before lockup expires
- One-time withdrawal per partner

⚠️ **Vault Management:**
- Monitor vault balances regularly
- Ensure sufficient balance before distributions
- Track spent vs remaining allocations

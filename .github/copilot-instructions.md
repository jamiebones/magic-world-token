# Magic World Token - AI Development Guide

## Project Overview

A play-to-earn ERC20 token system deployed on Polygon, designed for casual players with gas-efficient batch operations and role-based access control.

## Architecture

- **Token Contract:** `MagicWorldToken.sol` - ERC20 with batch transfers and RBAC
- **Game Contract:** `MagicWorldGame.sol` - Owns all tokens, manages P2E distribution
- **Network:** Polygon (low gas costs for frequent micro-transactions)
- **Supply:** Fixed supply, non-upgradeable contracts
- **Framework:** Hardhat for development, testing, and deployment

## Key Components

### Token Contract Features

- OpenZeppelin ERC20 base with AccessControl and Pausable
- Batch transfer functions: `batchTransfer()` and `batchTransferEqual()`
- Role-based permissions: `GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE`, `PAUSE_ROLE`
- Gas-optimized for frequent small rewards to casual players

### Game Contract Responsibilities

- Holds entire initial token supply (receives all tokens at deployment)
- Implements P2E reward distribution logic with daily limits
- Rate limiting and anti-abuse mechanisms
- Integration point for off-chain game servers via role-based access

## Development Patterns

### Role Management

```solidity
// Standard OpenZeppelin AccessControl pattern
bytes32 public constant GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE = keccak256("GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant PAUSE_ROLE = keccak256("PAUSE_ROLE");

// Grant operator role to game servers
grantRole(GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE, gameServerAddress);

// Batch transfers require GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE
function batchTransfer(address[] recipients, uint256[] amounts)
    external onlyRole(GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE) whenNotPaused
```

### Gas Optimization for Polygon

- Use `batchTransferEqual()` for same-amount distributions (daily rewards)
- Limit batch sizes to ~100-200 recipients per transaction
- Emit batch events for off-chain game state tracking
- All batch operations include input validation and overflow protection

### Contract Deployment Pattern

1. Deploy Token Contract with fixed total supply
2. Deploy Game Contract with Token Contract address
3. Transfer entire token supply to Game Contract
4. Grant GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE to Game Contract
5. Renounce admin role from deployer (optional security measure)

## Hardhat Development Workflow

### Key Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to Polygon testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygonAmoy

# Deploy to Polygon mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon

# Verify contracts on Polygonscan
npx hardhat verify --network polygon <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all role permissions and access controls
- Gas optimization tests for batch operations
- Integration tests between Token and Game contracts
- Stress tests for maximum batch sizes on Polygon
- Edge case tests for fixed supply constraints

### Network Configuration

- **Development:** Hardhat local network
- **Testnet:** Polygon Amoy for testing
- **Mainnet:** Polygon for production deployment
- Configure gas price strategies for Polygon in `hardhat.config.js`

## Security Considerations

- All contracts are non-upgradeable (immutable after deployment)
- Daily reward limits implemented in Game Contract
- Emergency pause functionality accessible via PAUSE_ROLE
- Input validation on all batch operations (array length matching)
- Fixed total supply prevents inflation attacks
- Role-based access prevents unauthorized token distribution

## Integration Points

- Game servers authenticate via GAME_OPERATOR_ROLE
- Events emitted for off-chain state synchronization
- Wallet integration optimized for casual players (minimal gas costs)
- Polygon network chosen specifically for low transaction fees
- Batch operations reduce gas costs for frequent P2E rewards

```

## Common Patterns

- Always use `whenNotPaused` modifier on critical functions
- Emit events for all significant state changes for game tracking
- Use OpenZeppelin's `_msgSender()` instead of `msg.sender`
- Implement proper error messages for better debugging
- Gas estimation should account for Polygon's lower costs vs Ethereum
